# Simple-Network-Scanner
This Bash script scans a local network by prompting the user for the first three octets of an IP address and a range of host numbers. It performs a ping sweep across the specified range, identifies which devices are online or offline, and prints a live report in the terminal with totals for active, inactive, and scanned hosts.
